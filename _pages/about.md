I am a **photonic engineer** applying advanced simulation and fabrication techniques to design high-performance integrated photonic devices for co-packaged optics and optical communication.

I earned my **Ph.D. in Molecular Engineering** (Optoelectronics Focus) from the University of Chicago, advised by [** Prof. Philippe Guyot-Sionnest **](https://pgslab.uchicago.edu/pgs/), where my research centered on the design, fabrication, and optical characterization of advanced photonic and optoelectronic devices using mercury chalcogenide nanocrystals. My doctoral work combined simulation-driven design with Lumerical FDTD and COMSOL Multiphysics, integrated with cleanroom fabrication and metrology for experimental validation.

Before my doctoral studies, I completed both my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Chemistry at the University of Oxford, advised by [** Prof. Richard Compton **](https://compton.chem.ox.ac.uk/), graduating with top honors and receiving multiple academic awards for research excellence. My educational background bridges physics, materials science, and engineering—providing a strong foundation for my ongoing work in integrated photonics and optical system design.
